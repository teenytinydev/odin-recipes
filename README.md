Odin Project 1 - Recipes

This is my first project based on the Odin project. 
This project requires me to build a website based on the HTML language I've learnt. 
Completing this project will allow me to practice and learn:
    1 How to use the common HTML tags/ elements
    2  Set up Repo and connect it to my machine
    3. Git Commiting my projects to Github
